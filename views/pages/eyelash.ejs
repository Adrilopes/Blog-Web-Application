    <h1>Eyelash Extensions Care</h1>

    <ul class="care-list">
        <li><strong>Avoid Getting Your Lashes Wet for 24 Hours</strong>  
            Refrain from water exposure for the first 24 hours to allow the adhesive to set properly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Be Gentle with Your Lashes</strong>  
            Avoid rubbing, pulling, or tugging on your lashes to prevent damage to both your natural lashes and the extensions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Oil-Free Products</strong>  
            Oil-based makeup removers and skincare products can break down the adhesive. Stick to oil-free cleansers and makeup removers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Mascara</strong>  
            Avoid applying mascara to your lash extensions as it can clump the lashes and cause them to fall out prematurely.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brush Your Lashes Daily</strong>  
            Gently brush your extensions with a clean spoolie to keep them neat and free of tangles.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sleep on Your Back</strong>  
            Try to sleep on your back to avoid rubbing your lashes against your pillow, which can lead to twisting or pulling the extensions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Donâ€™t Pick or Pull on Your Extensions</strong>  
            If an extension is loose or uncomfortable, contact your technician for a professional fix instead of pulling on it yourself.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Limit Exposure to Heat and Steam</strong>  
            Excessive heat, such as from saunas or hot showers, can weaken the adhesive, so try to avoid long exposures.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Schedule Regular Fills</strong>  
            Lash extensions naturally shed with your natural lashes, so schedule fill appointments every 2-3 weeks to keep them full and looking fresh.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Be Patient with Your Lashes</strong>  
            Your natural lashes may need time to adjust, so be patient and gentle with them, allowing them to settle into the new extensions.
        </li>
    </ul>
