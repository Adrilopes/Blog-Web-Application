    <h1>Eyebrow Lamination Care</h1>

    <ul class="care-list">
        <li><strong>Avoid Wetting Your Brows for 24 Hours</strong>  
            Refrain from getting your brows wet for the first 24 hours after the procedure to ensure the setting solution fully adheres.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Keep Your Brows Dry</strong>  
            Avoid excessive sweating, steam, or exposure to water during the first 48 hours to allow the lamination to set properly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Gentle Cleansers</strong>  
            Opt for mild, non-oily cleansers when cleaning your face, especially around the brow area, to prevent any damage to the lamination.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Touching Your Brows</strong>  
            Refrain from touching or brushing your brows too often in the first few days to avoid disturbing the shape.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Apply Moisturizing Oils</strong>  
            Keep your brows nourished by applying nourishing oils (like castor oil or jojoba oil) to prevent them from becoming dry or brittle.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Chemicals</strong>  
            Stay away from products with strong chemicals or exfoliants, which may weaken the lamination effect.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use a Brow Brush</strong>  
            Gently brush your brows daily to maintain their shape and ensure they look neat.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Sleeping on Your Face</strong>  
            Try to sleep on your back during the first few nights after the procedure to avoid pressing your brows into your pillow.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Regular Touch-ups</strong>  
            Consider scheduling touch-ups every 6-8 weeks to maintain the shape and fullness of your laminated brows.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Be Patient with Results</strong>  
            Allow a few days for your brows to settle into their new shape and texture before making any adjustments.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These tips will help ensure the longevity of your eyebrow lamination and keep them looking great!</p>
